# 🧩 Node.js MVC Practice Project

This project was developed as a personal exercise to practice **Node.js** fundamentals and backend architecture.  
It follows the **MVC pattern**, including **validation middlewares**, **authentication**, and **automated testing** to simulate a real-world API structure.  
Additionally, the project is **deployed on Google Cloud** and integrated with a **CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployment and testing.

## 🚀 Features

- **MVC Architecture** — clear separation between Models, Views, and Controllers.  
- **Express.js** — route handling and HTTP server setup.  
- **Yup** — data validation middleware for request schemas.  
- **SQLite3** — lightweight relational database for development.  
- **JWT Authentication** — secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens.  
- **Auth.js** — authentication flow management.  
- **Jest** — unit and integration testing framework.  
- **Google Cloud Integration** — cloud deployment and environment configuration.  
- **CI/CD Pipeline** — automated build, test, and deployment process.
